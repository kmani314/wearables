First thing is a fitness watch:
* Using nRF52840 as the SOC, includes BT on chip
    * This version will not have WiFi
* MAX32664 and MAX86141 for heart rate, pulse oximetry, associated LEDs and photodiode
* Small TFT LCD
* MAX77659 for power management
* Small Li-ion
* USB-C
Most of the maxim parts only come in really small WLCSP type packages, unclear if JLC can produce them or if they are hand-solderable with good repeatability.
